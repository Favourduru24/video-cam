 Hi Peter A,
I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to thank you for the opportunity to interview for the Full Stack Developer role at Molaprise. I really enjoyed our discussion about full-stack architecture and learning more about the companyâ€™s vision and approach.

Since our conversation, Iâ€™ve updated my CV and also wanted to share a SaaS application I recently built that demonstrates my skills in React, Node.js, and scalable architecture. I believe it aligns well with the kind of innovative work Molaprise is doing.

Here are the details:

Warm regards,
